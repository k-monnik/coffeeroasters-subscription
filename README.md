## currently under construction

## Tools
This project was built with React and Tailwind v3.


## The challenge

This challenge involved building out this multi-page coffee subscription website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Make selections to create a coffee subscription and see an order summary modal of their choices
